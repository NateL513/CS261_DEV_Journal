# Week 3

I looked up a few Mock Users that me and our group could use. We ended up settling with using MockPlus.

The best two I found:

I made a Mock UI through Mockplus, learning how it works and the basics of it. I specifically made a Homescreen. I also downloaded the MOCKPLUS mobile app so I can see what the UIs would look like on  the screen of a mobile device.

I made more Mock UIs. This time I made profile, edit profile, edit notifications, about, settings, calendar, and notification pages. I also made another home screen to try and get more variety in ideas to dicuss with the IOS group so both groups can come to an agreement on the layout of the app. Along with that I made it to where I can display these Mock UIs onto my phone. I also learned how to make buttons interactive and take you to the corresponding page. It was a little difficult trying to figure it out ,due to MOCKPLUS still being new to me, but after playing around with it for a bit I figured it out.
