I continued trying to adapt what Jake had in his profile fragment that fetched the data from the database in a way to where it would do the same for notifcations on my notifcations page. While doing this, I realized issues that may come with that. One issue being that that the content from the database is not going to be at a set index, rather it would appear at random indexs as well as it having to be clicked and take you to which ever page/fragment itis describing. I had difficult time trying to figure out how to get around it and needed the help from Jake becuase he has the most experience with android studios.

I looked up ways to implement the database into a androidstudios trying to see if there are any examples if the list being random lengths and the order of data in the list is random as well. I found a good stack overflow that gives me code example of making a recyclerview using the database, as well  as a link that led me to an example of a gridview. It was more about the various implementations of databases into Android studios so I can get a better understanding

I talked to jake more about the coding and figured out a plan on how I should try and code an even better notifications page. I spent time studying images of code from a previous project he had done for Cintas and tried to connect it with my code and what I want the notifcations page of our app to do. I can came to the conclusion that I should you a recyclerview instead of a list view. A recycler view is like a list view, but items in the list can be deleted from the list. This is important because users should have the option to delete unwanted/old notifications.
