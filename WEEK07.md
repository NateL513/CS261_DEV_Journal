# Week 7

#### **10/25/2022 and 10/26/2022 **
I spent time finding my code in github and retyping it in Android studios AGAIN. I had to do this because of a posible issue with Android studios. I also looked into making a better notifications page by looking at other xavier apps for some motivation on what aspects mine should have.

I finished up my MOCKPLUS presentation and planned on how I was going to present the information. I will use my phone to present the slides and my app. This way I woudn't have to disconnect from zoom and prolong the presentation. Along with that I looked up key elements that user frinedly nottifactions should have and found a good site that gives the basic idea of these certain elements.

I found out there was no issue with Android studios! The issue was that I was not pulling my forked repository to my local repo. After talking to you, I made the connection and realized it was me and not github or android studios. I just forgot the order of steps as well as forgetting one of the steps.
