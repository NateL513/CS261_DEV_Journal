# Week 4

#### Overall
I could not do a lot this week because I ran into technical issues with my laptop over the weekend and had to take it to microcenter to get help. 

#### **10/3/2022**
I tried to figure out how to add buttons and fragments to android studios. I found it pretty difficult to do because I am still getting used to this new resource. Along with that I navigated through the code of our repo to try and understand what each part of the resource did. For example, where the files that made different parts of the app different colors along with how to change those colors and theme of the app. Finding some of the stuff and understanding it is somewhat difficut due to there being a lot of files and the code that is already given isn't always the clearest. 

#### **10/4/2022**
I synced my fork with what my group pushed to the github repo and ran into issues. I spent some time trying to figure out what the issue was and found that it was an issue with Android studios. Android studios changes the SDK of the project from the orginal to the SDK of the person who pushed the changes. I could not fully figure out how to fix it, but my group luckily ended up creating a new repo.
