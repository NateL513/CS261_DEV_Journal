# Week 11

#### **12/1/2022 **
I spent a lot of time solving several errors that I had when I pulled the commits that my team members made to the project. Along with that I finished my documentation for notifications. I started working on helping joey finish up some of the fragments  and distributing the work load. 
#### **11/29/2022 **
I tried to resolve merge conflicts when I pushed my branch to the main, but I need more help from my team just so I do not cause any errors for others. I also spent time helping joey solve errors that he got when he pulled from the main repo. Including that I worked a bit on the fragments that joey needed help finishing, he needed help because he wants to have some sort of idea/objects within all of the fragments. This is not only for us, but it is for future students  to work and extend off of.
