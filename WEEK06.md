# Week 6

#### **10/18/2022 and 10/19/2022 **
I spent time finding my code in github and retyping it in Android studios. I had to do this because I incorrectly did the Githib process and when I synced my repo stuff with the main repo, I lost my code. Luckily I pushed my code and and reverted that push before this issue occurred. Making it somewhat easier to get my code back. I now know to use branches so issues like this will not occur. The only other issue that I have now is that the Android studios won't work correctly and I plan on asking my group members for help on the issue. I tried to figure it out myself, but couldn't find much help online.

I continued trying to figure out the issue with Android Studios. I found the exact error that occurs:

'C:\Users\natel\AndroidStudioProjects\Android-eXperience-App-\app\build\intermediates\apk\debug\app-debug.apk'
Installation failed due to: 'Failed to install-write all apks'

I didn't fully find a solution to the problem, but I restarted the application and it ended up fixing itself. Another thing I did was work a bit more on my presentation and think of ways to present the mock UI on my phone.
