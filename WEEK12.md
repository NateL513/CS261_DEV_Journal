# Week 12

#### **12/6/2022 **
I helped my team members through figuring out any issues when pushing their branches and making sure that everything is set for the end of the semester. I talked my grou members to try and figure out what all should we put on the framents. We came to the conclusion that we shouldn't add too much, that way the future programmers will have more room to work and build off what we did.

I worked on adding an image to the Undergraduate research and the internship fragments. Along with that I updated the documentation to those fragments along with my notifications fragment. That way the future programmers have an idea of what the fragment does and what else should be put into it. Overall, this was a great experience and can't wait to see what becomes of this.
