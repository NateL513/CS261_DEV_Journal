I added a listview to our notifications fragment. It was somewhat difficult because I had to edit two seperate files just to have it display on 1 page. Along with that I added more list items in a list that is in our "more" fragment that being a "About", "Help & feedback", overall "settings". That part was easier once I figured out how to make the list and have it print the strings I wanted in the notifications pages. Lastly I looked up ways to add events to a calendar so users could do it, and I found a  nice link that runs through and gives code on an idea of how to do it.

I started to make my presentation on MockPlus. This being a resource me and my group used to make a Mock User interface. Also I started to look and make sure the info I have is well defined, like what is a Mock UI. Lastly, I figured a way out to present my Mock UI and show a basic "layout" that the android group is goin off on and the interactions that may come with the application.
