# Week 8
#### **11/1/2022 **
I added my notifications code from my groups previous repo to the groups actual repo. I did this because our group made the mistake of making a repo that was not aprt of the class organization, along with that our group as a whole was not doing the github process correctly. I also looked up examples of code on how to implement an empty notifications list and fill it when a notification pops up.

#### **11/2/2022 **
I added dummy data to my groups database within "FIREBASE" to have an idea of what info should be popping up with the notification. Specifically the NAME of the notifcation, which specifies which event(event type) is occuring and/or one that is of interest to the user. For example, EVENT TYPE 1 : "Study Abroad". While doing that, I read through Jake Heyser's code to see how to implement this dummy data into android studios. I need to talk to him more about it so I can get a better understanding of it. 

#### **11/3/2022 **
I pushed and commited my code successfully and tried to implement Jake's code in a way that works with my data that I need to display on the notification page. It was a litle difficult tryin to convert the my code to work with the data base. It was difficult because I had to change pretty much all of my code which imports the notifications from our firebase database.
